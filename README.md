# Language_Translators
Code and Instructions to Run
The code for this assignment is provided in the document. To run the code, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:
transformers (for loading pre-trained translation models)
nltk (for calculating BLEU scores)
torch (for tensor operations)
sentence_transformers (for computing text similarity)
vaderSentiment (for sentiment analysis)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

If you use github follow the steps
First go to this link : https://github.com/zuhaaaaaaa/Language_Translators
Open vscode  
Then the run terminal this code : pip install -r requirements.txt



Additionally, you will need to download the necessary NLTK data by running:


“import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')”

If you colab you just need to run all the code.

Once you have installed the dependencies and downloaded the required NLTK data, you can run the code as is. It will print the translations, BLEU scores, similarity scores, sentiment analysis results, and token count.
